        <h2 style="margin-left: 197px;">Personal support worker addendum</h2>
        <p>
            Personal support workers (PSWs) are mandatory reporters in Oregon and must follow
            the requirements of OAR 407-045-0260. PSWs may have their state provider number
            (SPD) inactivated or terminated by the department for violating the rules found in OAR
            411-375-0070.
        </p>
        <p>
            PSWs are at-will employees of the common law employer (CLE) identified below. The
            CLE or PSW may end this relationship without cause at any time. The CLE is solely
            responsible for scheduling, hiring, discipline, approving time worked and termination.
        </p>
        <p>
            A PSW is not an employee of Oregon (except for the purposes of collective
            bargaining), the Oregon Home Care Commission (OHCC) or local case management
            entity. PSWs must have proper credentials and an active provider number to be paid
            with Medicaid funds. Community developmental disabilities programs or brokerages
            may need additional documentation to ensure the health and safety of the individual
            being served. Failure to maintain credentials may be cause for termination of this
            authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
            PSWs are eligible for benefits outlined in the most current Homecare Worker/Personal
            Support Worker Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Questions about workers'
            compensation for injuries received while performing job duties or training should be
            directed to OHCC. Contact the Homecare Worker Supplemental and Benefits Trust at
            1-844-507-7554 or email <span style="color:blue">OHCWT@bsitpa.com</span> for information on other benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The work units authorized on page one of this document are the total number of hours
            a PSW may work in the specified time period. The provider may not bill for more than
            the hours authorized unless the CLE requests additional hours to meet an emergent
            need (e.g., coverage for another provider, emergency related to the individual, etc.),
            and the hours are available in the supported person’s plan. The CLE must notify the
            case management entity within two business days if they authorize a PSW to work
            more than the authorized hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            A PSW may not work for more hours in a work week than allowed for in rule or as
            stated in the CBA unless an exception is approved and on file with the case
            management entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rate of pay authorized on page one of this document is subject to terms of the
            most current CBA. The rate may be adjusted without notice or revision to this
            agreement if the terms of the CBA require a change to the rate. No other rate changes
            are authorized without notification to the provider and CLE.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay dates are set by the Oregon state contract payroll calendar. All timesheets must
            ODDS Provider Service Agreement Page 3 of 4 DHS 4606 (7/16)
            be submitted by the payment deadline to be paid on a payroll run. Late, incomplete or
            inaccurate timesheets will not be processed until the next run.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a PSW, you acknowledge that you are bound by the rules found in OAR 411-375
            and OAR 411-450.
        </p>
        <p>
            By signing this service agreement, you are agreeing to perform the duties as outlined
            above. This authorization is not valid until signed by all parties listed below.
