<!-- This page is here because we need to route Mentor and non-mentors differently
     (controlled by the action attribute of the page). I (Dang) tried to
     include this action inside the MentorView page itself, but that leads to
     an internal server error on SF (maybe because they can't handle circular
     dependency?) so now the 2 pages are separate.
