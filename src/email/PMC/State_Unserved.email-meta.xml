    <textOnly>Hi {!Prospects__c.First_Name__c},
 
Thank you for your interest in becoming a Mentor and making a difference in someone’s life. Although The MENTOR Network provides services in {!Prospects__c.zzEmailStateName__c}, we do not currently offer our Host Home or foster care services―the programs where we partner with individuals who are interested in making a difference by opening their hearts and homes to individuals in need of support―in your state.
 
 We will keep you posted in the event we expand our services in {!Prospects__c.zzEmailStateName__c} in the future.  
 
 To learn more about us please visit www.thementornetwork.com. 
 
 Thanks again for your interest in becoming a Mentor! </textOnly>
