The child may demonstrate such difficulties with a single type or a wide range of emotions and energy states. This can also include difficulties with regulation of body functions, including disturbances in sleeping, eating, and elimination; over-reactivity or under-reactivity to touch and sounds; and physical or somatic complaints.
